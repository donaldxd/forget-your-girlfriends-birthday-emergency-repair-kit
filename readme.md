## Does this really work?
It should, as long as you deploy it fast enough before your relationship is corrupted. The original was coded and deployed within one hour of the ground zero/event horizon/realization of fuckup; you may need more or less time to make it believable and effective.

## Is there a CLI on the way?
Possibly, if there's sufficient demand. Which there should be.
